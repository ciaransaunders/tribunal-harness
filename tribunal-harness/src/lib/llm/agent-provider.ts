/**
 * Agent Stand-In LLM Provider — Tribunal Harness
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The managed-API / provider decision for the LLM layer has not been made yet
 * (see the "Open Design Decisions" in the master spec: BYOK vs managed key, and
 * which model vendor). Until that is selected — and an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is wired
 * — the AI routes (/api/analyse, /api/triage, /api/debate) degrade and cannot
 * produce a full report. That makes a true end-to-end smoke run impossible.
 *
 * This module is a deterministic, OFFLINE agent that *stands in* for the
 * unselected LLM API. When `LLM_PROVIDER=agent`, callClaude() routes here instead
 * of the Anthropic SDK. It returns well-formed, schema-conformant JSON for every
 * endpoint, derived from the real claim schemas (src/schemas) and the ERA 2025
 * single source of truth (src/lib/constants). It is the seam an LLM coding agent
 * — or a future real provider — slots into.
 *
 * HERMETICITY (legal-safety critical)
 * -----------------------------------
 * /api/analyse independently re-verifies every cited authority. A *curated*
 * VERIFIED short-circuits with NO network call (see citation-validator.ts). So
 * the authorities synthesised here cite ONLY curated short-names whose leading
 * token(s) match the known-good list in verified-authorities.ts. This keeps the
 * smoke run fully offline and never falsely "verifies" an invented citation.
 *
 * This file produces legal INFORMATION, not legal advice (LSA 2007). It is a
 * fixture/stand-in, not a substitute for a real model's judgement.
